Everything was silent but still, he took each step with caution as he walked to the door at the corridor’s end.
His feet bare as his shoes had abandonned him long ago, Pao Chif tiptoed, as much as his trembling legs let him.
A meeting room to his left had had large windows, which had been long since broken, probably by the bonelings, and through there came in some moonlight which Pao feared, as he must not be seen tonight, not until he walked through the last door. From there also blowed the night breeze, chilling him at the chest where he had been wearing nothing but a transparent, sullied trash bag.

His stomach growled. He jumped, looked around, but no one was there to be seen. He let out a sigh and without thinking he mumbled to himself, “I am alone.”
Then he caught himself, clasped a hand on his mouth and with a wild gaze he turned. And yet he thought again to himself, “Yes, I am alone.” His stomach hurt again. “And starving.” he admitted.

With one hand, Pao Chif was holding up his pants which were always falling off his hipbones, while he reached for the door handle with his other one.
Grabbing the handle hurt his finger joints with every movement, and the metal rod was rusty and rough to the touch. It was cold and dry but Pao had to go through this door. As he had explored the skyscraper he had not met another living person, animal, or plant. Only fungi seemed to thrive, yet he had vomited many times before trying to feed off dirt and shapeless mycelium. Then he had seen the tower. It reached so high that its tip was over the fog sometimes. How had the bonelings not found him before he did not know, maybe it was because even they had deserted the place. Every door had been opened and taken off its hinges, every window shattered, holes in every wall: they had done there deed, and will, color, and hope had been ripped out.

However there it was, a closed door, with no lock, but closed. He told himself, one more time, he would open it, walk through, and there he would find peace. That was meant to be.

Slowly, he pushed the handle down, and suddenly the door fell away. Pao had to cover his eyes for a moment as he was blinded by unexpected sunlight.
Behind that door there was but a gaping hole, as if the largest of all bonelings had climbed the building and taken a bite of it. But this single door had remained, leading to nowhere, and now it was gone, far down dozens of floors away.

There he stood and, finally, his eyes adjusted to the light. Over the horizon was the sun, which lit, far beyond the outer reaches of the city, far beyond the grey-white mass of the bonelings who were waiting, restlessly, for flesh to tear apart and devour, far beyond the labyrinthic and narrow streets, there was blue, the sky, green, the meadows, gold, the fields and the sun, and specks of purple, red, brown, and orange. Standing far away in the bright landscape, there were two figures, holding hands, and waving at something.

Pao Chif had not walked through the door as there was no floor beyond it. He had seen people. They seemed alive, they seemed safe, they were together. He had told himself over and over that he would find the door, open it, walk through and find peace. Maybe peace was through that door. Holding the doorframe with both his hands he lifted a foot over the edge and closed his eyes. “Find peace,” he thought.

Yet he knew now, that it was somehow possible, that some people had made it out, or had never been here. There was a place without the bonelings. With his eyes still closed he took a deep breath, put down his foot, and took a step back into the corridor. “Find peace.”
